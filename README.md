Welcome to my (truji@mit.edu) 12.411 repo. I won't be doing much with this except for pushing the files I'm using for my pipeline. 

I'm working on NEA astrometry with a focus on developing a smooth pipeline for reduction.
The goal is for it to be applicable everywhere, not just at the Observatorio del Teide in Tenerife.
